Directions to use: -
The project works on a specific database with the help of the .SQL file which is attached with the project files. The user needs to launch the sql file which will create the tables and relationships with the tables allowing us to control the project using sessions. After completing the launching of the SQL data file on the Microsoft SQL Server. Run the file on the IIS Server and it will be good to go!
1. Launch SQL Query for creating the database.
2. Make sure the Microsoft SQL Server is running successfully.
3. Once you see the session is being restored throughout the session, then you're good to go!
